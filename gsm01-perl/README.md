gsm01-perl - Sam's Mastery Grading Script (written in Perl)
===========================================================

The primary script is `gsm`. As of 2024-01-03, it's still in a state of flux, moving from something I've used for the past few years to something a bit more general.

Using the script
----------------

* Edit `gsmrc`, which specifies the general grading policies.
* Download the CSV file from Gradescope.
* Run `gsmrc FILE.csv`.
* Cross your fingers.
* Look in the `reports` directory for the various reports.

Other options
-------------

Run `gsm` without any additional information to see what options are available to you.
